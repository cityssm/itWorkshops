      <p>
        In July 2019, the City of Sault Ste. Marie launched automated garbage collection.
        With the new system came new roll-out garbage carts for all residents,
        and new collection days for about 28% of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Residents can find out their collection day on the Collection Calendar page on the City website.
        The page includes an interactive map inviting residents to enter their address to confirm their collection day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This entry level workshop uses the same data that feeds the interactive map
        and analyzes it in several ways to answer questions.
